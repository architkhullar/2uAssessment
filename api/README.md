### API
* To run the project, go inside the api folder and run `npm run start`
* The api is now live and can be accessed on `http://localhost:1337/Invoice`

* My choice of DB here is MongoDB Cloud.
* see the screenshot below which shows how the data is stored

* Below is the project structure
* some TODOs left in the Invoicecontroller.js and server.js like jwt.io integration and some validations. They can be implemented to make the APIs secure and more accurate.
